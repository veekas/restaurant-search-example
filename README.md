# Restaurant Search

## Note

This is likely to stop working in **April 2018** because my Algolia demo subscription will expire. I'll need to modify this so it says "Powered by Algolia"

## In progress

  1. implement `Show More` button
  2. highlight active filters
  3. clear button for active filters/search
  4. tweak styling to better match mockup
  5. custom query rules through the API (I manually implemented "cheap")
  6. hide/show filters in mobile view
